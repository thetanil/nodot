# nodot
Dotfiles For Noders

## More Specifically
1. js dev (you have npm and node already)
2. vim 4 life (with all the html,js,css stuff ready)
3. bash (nothing against zsh, but bash is enough sh for me)
4. some scripts and system aliases are debian/raspbian specific
5. I try to keep my shell scripting POSIX sh

# Quick Start

1. FORK YOUR OWN COPY
2. git clone git@github.com:thetanil/nodot.git (replace thetanil/nodot.git with your fork)
3. cd nodot
4. npm install
5. npm start

Answer some questions?
i want to nodot my bash
i want to nodot my vim

now nodot is in your path

if the first character of a filename or directory
  under path.join(__dirname, 'home')
  is an underscore, the corresponding link will have
  the '_' replaced with a '.'

everything under files/nodot will be linked
  ln -s



aliases will be managed by nodot via
  nodot alias cmd replacement
